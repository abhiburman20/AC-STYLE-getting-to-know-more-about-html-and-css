                <h2>
                    Google Maps now tells you when a face mask is required on public transport
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Maps launched a bunch of features yesterday to help you get more information about your government’s coronavirus-related regulations. As cities are opening up 
                    around the world, authorities are enforcing new rules for public transit to maintain safety and social distancing.<br>
                    The company says that when you look for public transport options to reach a place on Google Maps, you’ll get alerts and set of requirements — such as if you need to wear a mask — to use 
                    these services from local authorities<br>
                     Google Maps is also rolling out alerts for routes that might take you across the border such as the US-Canada or the US-Mexico checkpoint, so that you can prepare for COVID-19 restrictions 
                    laid out by that country.

                    How’s everyone doing? Barely holding it together and on the brink of lunacy? Yep, me too. Like the rest of you, I’m bracing for… whatever happens next. To the 
                    best of my knowledge there’s never been global protests during a pandemic. I don’t think anyone’s sure what July will bring.<br>

                <p class="p3">
                    But life is moving on whether we’re ready or not. At this point, it feels like social distancing is a personal choice. It’s as though the seal’s been broken on 
                    quarantine. Still, many of us will continue to shelter-in-place until we can be sure the danger’s passed for us and those we care about. It’s a tough time to be 
                    someone who’s eager to get outside, but wary of exposure.<br>

                    Worst of all it’s Pride month and we’ll be celebrating alone. This would have been the first year my fiance and I attended the celebrations in San Diego, but now 
                    it’s all happening online. And that’s pretty surreal.<br>

                    Pride’s a 50-year-old celebration of queerness that’s meant to give us a safe space to be our authentic selves in public. And, just as importantly, it shows the
                     public that queers aren’t strange or weird; we’re your neighbors and co-workers.<br>
                </p>
                <p class="p1">
                    I’m saddened I won’t get to watch a Pride parade in person this year. But the shift to virtual events for the queer community comes with a silver lining: almost 
                    everybody can attend. It doesn’t matter if you’re disabled, in the closet, or if you just don’t like crowds. You can attend Pride events around the world from the
                     comfort of your home or office this year. I think that’s pretty cool.<br>

                    Ten years ago, it would have been far-fetched to imagine moving a planet’s worth of Pride celebrations online so they can be streamed to billions. Technology is 
                    lifting some of the burdens historically shouldered by the marginalized, and I’m totally here for it.<br>
