                <h2>
                    Twitter is bringing its Stories-like Fleets feature to India
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitter said today that it’s rolling out its ephemeral tweets experiment to India today. In March, the company started experimenting with this feature in Brazil.

                    Last month, the social network expanded the experiment to Italy. Now, it’s rolling it out in India — which has more than 400 million internet users.<br>
                    These ephemeral updates, just like Stories features of Instagram, disappear after 24 hours. The company didn’t specify how many people are using this feature. 
                    But given that it’s making it available in another country suggests that at least some users are interested.

                <h2>
                    Google Maps now tells you when a face mask is required on public transport
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Maps launched a bunch of features yesterday to help you get more information about your government’s coronavirus-related regulations. As cities are opening up 
                    around the world, authorities are enforcing new rules for public transit to maintain safety and social distancing.<br>
                    The company says that when you look for public transport options to reach a place on Google Maps, you’ll get alerts and set of requirements — such as if you need to wear a mask — to use 
                    these services from local authorities<br>
                     Google Maps is also rolling out alerts for routes that might take you across the border such as the US-Canada or the US-Mexico checkpoint, so that you can prepare for COVID-19 restrictions 
                    laid out by that country.
