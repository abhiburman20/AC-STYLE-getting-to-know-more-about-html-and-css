                <h2>
                    Twitter is bringing its Stories-like Fleets feature to India
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitter said today that it’s rolling out its ephemeral tweets experiment to India today. In March, the company started experimenting with this feature in Brazil.

                    Last month, the social network expanded the experiment to Italy. Now, it’s rolling it out in India — which has more than 400 million internet users.<br>
                    These ephemeral updates, just like Stories features of Instagram, disappear after 24 hours. The company didn’t specify how many people are using this feature. 
                    But given that it’s making it available in another country suggests that at least some users are interested.

                    How’s everyone doing? Barely holding it together and on the brink of lunacy? Yep, me too. Like the rest of you, I’m bracing for… whatever happens next. To the 
                    best of my knowledge there’s never been global protests during a pandemic. I don’t think anyone’s sure what July will bring.<br>

                    But life is moving on whether we’re ready or not. At this point, it feels like social distancing is a personal choice. It’s as though the seal’s been broken on 
                    quarantine. Still, many of us will continue to shelter-in-place until we can be sure the danger’s passed for us and those we care about. It’s a tough time to be 
                    someone who’s eager to get outside, but wary of exposure.<br>

                    Worst of all it’s Pride month and we’ll be celebrating alone. This would have been the first year my fiance and I attended the celebrations in San Diego, but now 
                    it’s all happening online. And that’s pretty surreal.<br>

                    Pride’s a 50-year-old celebration of queerness that’s meant to give us a safe space to be our authentic selves in public. And, just as importantly, it shows the
                     public that queers aren’t strange or weird; we’re your neighbors and co-workers.<br>
                </p>
                <p class="p1">
                    I’m saddened I won’t get to watch a Pride parade in person this year. But the shift to virtual events for the queer community comes with a silver lining: almost 
                    everybody can attend. It doesn’t matter if you’re disabled, in the closet, or if you just don’t like crowds. You can attend Pride events around the world from the
                     comfort of your home or office this year. I think that’s pretty cool.<br>

                    Ten years ago, it would have been far-fetched to imagine moving a planet’s worth of Pride celebrations online so they can be streamed to billions. Technology is 
                    lifting some of the burdens historically shouldered by the marginalized, and I’m totally here for it.<br>
